ChIP-seq Pipeline maps reads with Bowtie2, removes duplicates with Picard or Samtools, calls ChIP peaks with MACS2 and finally creates count table for analysis.  Additionally these peaks analyzed by Motif Finder module (HOMER).

#### Steps:
  1. For Quality Control, we use FastQC to create qc outputs. There are optional read quality filtering (trimmomatic), read quality trimming (trimmomatic), adapter removal (cutadapt) processes available.
  2. In the sequential mapping step, Bowtie2 is used to count or filter out common reads (eg. ercc, rmsk). 
  3. Bowtie2 is used to align reads to a selected genome, and duplicates removed with Picard or Samtools,
  4. When processing several samples together, pipeline provide consensus peak calls by merging all peaks individually called in each samples using Bedtools (Quinlan and Hall 2010). The number of reads in each peak location are then quantified using Bedtools (Quinlan and Hall 2010) coverage function.
  5. Optionally, genome-wide Bam analysis is done by RseQC, and Picardâ€™s CollectRNASeqMetrics program.
  6. Optionally, you can create Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)  and Genome Browser Files (TDF and Bigwig, respectively)
  7. Optionally, these peaks analyzed by Motif Finder module (HOMER).
  8. As a result, pipeline generates a matrix that has the count values for each peak region and samples. This matrix can be uploaded directly to the embedded version of DEBrowser (Kucukural et al. 2019) to perform differential analysis or downloaded to perform other analysis.

#### Inputs:

  - Reads
  - ChIP-prep section

There are three fields need to be entered: output-prefix, sample-prefix, and input-prefix. Please use sample names to fill this form.For instance, to enter following files control-rep1.fastq.gz, exper-rep1.fastq.gz,  as the following.

    | output-prefix | sample-prefix | input-prefix |
    |---------------|---------------|--------------|
    | exper         |   exper-rep1  | control-rep1 |
    | control       |  control-rep1 |              |
